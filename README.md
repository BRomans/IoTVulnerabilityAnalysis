# IoTVulnerabilityAnalysis
A software to retrieve and analyze data  from IoT devices all over the world. Built on the ELK stack and powered by Shodan engine.

# How does it work
Using Apache Nifi dataflow processors and Python scripts this software retrieves data in JSON format from Shodan API. Then it evaluates
different fields of each device and compose a richer JSON containing valuable information about the vulnerability of the device.
Finally all data flow to ElastichSearch and Kibana where it's possible to analyze and aggregate results in several ways thanks to
a well designed dashboard.
